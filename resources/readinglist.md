## Here's a reading list that I'm going through to try to improve my theoretical knowledge and background on microfinance/dev econ.

**['Banker To The Poor' by Muhammad Yunus](https://archive.org/details/BankerToThePoor/page/n11/mode/2up)**

*Yunus, considered the father of microlending, narrates the birth of the movement in the midst of Bangladesh's 1974 famine.
He details the use-case for microcredit in spaces where large NGOs fall short or priorities are misaligned, and why local economies in the developing world can tend towards structural problems enabling usury.*


**['Why Nations Fail' by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson](https://ia801506.us.archive.org/27/items/WhyNationsFailTheOriginsODaronAcemoglu/Why-Nations-Fail_-The-Origins-o-Daron-Acemoglu.pdf)**

*The authors, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Economics for work related to this publication, give a well-researched historical/economic narrative of modern global capitalism, 
and suggest that there is a strong positive relationship between strong political institutions and equitable economic structures.*

**['Capital in the 21st Century' by Thomas Piketty](https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006)**

*Piketty endeavors to quantify the uneven rates of growth in wealth and income across societies in the first of its kind large-scale historical data analysis*
